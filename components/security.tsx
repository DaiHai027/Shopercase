            At Shopercase, we understand the importance of protecting your data.
            Thatâ€™s why we have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) by
            default on all of our accounts. 2FA provides an additional layer of
            security and ensures that only authorized users can access your
            account. With 2FA, you can rest assured that your account is secure
            and your data is safe.

            encryption technology helps to protect your data from unauthorized
            access and provides an additional layer of security for your
